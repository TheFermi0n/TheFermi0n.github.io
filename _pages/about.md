Exploring the infinite wonders of theoretical physics while embracing life's enigmatic beauty. Passionate about unraveling the fundamentals of the universe and the intricate stories it holds.

My current research  delves into the intriguing intersection of quantum gravity (QG) and particle physics, with a particular emphasis on unraveling the gravitational effects Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) — notably within the Higgs sector.

In the quest for new physics beyond the Standard Model, the Higgs sector stands as a potential gateway to understanding higher-scale phenomena. I believe that advancing field theories under the influence of gravity is crucial for studying BSM physics and unlocking the secrets that lie beyond our current understanding.

> I welcome inquiries, collaboration opportunities, and discussions related to my research. Feel free to connect, and let's explore the infinite wonders of theoretical physics together.
